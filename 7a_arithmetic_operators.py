#Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

#Addition
x = 5
y = 3

print(x + y)

#Subtraction
x = 5
y = 3

print(x - y)

#Multiplication
x = 5
y = 3

print(x * y)

#Division
x = 12
y = 3

print(x / y)

#Modulus (It is a remainder value)
x = 5
y = 2

print(x % y)
